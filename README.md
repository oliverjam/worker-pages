# Cloudflare Workers Pages

An experiment to get filesystem routing working with a Cloudflare Worker. Using esbuild to bundle a directory of routes into a single Worker with a router. Pages structure semi-inspired by [Remix](https://remix.run).

Cloudflare Pages now supports [Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions), which is effectively a first-class version of this, so go use that instead!
